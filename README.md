# Rusty Racket

Interpreter for the Racket programming language written in Rust.

### Usage

```
cargo run <filename>
```

### Todo

-   [ ] add comments
-   [ ] refactor to make names more consistent

### Future ideas

-   [ ] support functions as first class citizens
-   [ ] support command line arguments into the racket programs
-   [ ] variable number of arguments to a function maybe if there is exactly a single argument with a keyword name like argslist
